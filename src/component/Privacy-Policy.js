        Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and
        Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that
        a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a
        website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser
        can block that website from collecting certain information about the
        browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are
        not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Playdates,
        do not currently respond to DNT signals.{" "}

        7. CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS
      </h2>
      <p className="Policy-text">
        Sharing of information laid out in Section 6 sometimes involves
        cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of
        America and other jurisdictions. As an example, where the service allows
        for users to be located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), their
        personal information is transferred to countries outside of the EEA. We
        use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or
        other suitable safeguard to permit data transfers from the EEA to other
        countries. Standard contractual clauses are commitments between
        companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the
        privacy and security of your data.{" "}

        <li>
          Reviewing your information. Applicable privacy laws may give you the
          right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending
          on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of
          portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy of
          your personal information by putting in such a request.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          Updating your information. If you believe that the information we hold
          about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it
          and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its
          processing, please contact us.{" "}

      <p className="Policy-text">
        Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if
        the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or
        intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to
        receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any
        messages you received from him or her through our service, the other
        user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written
        consent before the information is released.{" "}

        Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to
        the processing of personal information, notably where such requests
        would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance,
        we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.{" "}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app by
          uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device.
          If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique
          identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If
          you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be
          able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and
          activities.{" "}

          protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your
          personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a
          complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where
          you work or where we are established.{" "}
